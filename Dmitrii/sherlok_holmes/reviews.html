      <p>If there is one genre I began to detest over the years, it was the 'buddy-action' flicks. You know the movies
        where two guys who aren't exactly friends are forced to form an uneasy alliance which leads to hilarious
        escapades. It's only been done a thousand and one times, note the long line of duos: Bruce Willis & Samuel L.
        Jackson ("Die Hard 3"), Will Smith & ("Wild Wild West"), Chris Tucker & Jackie Chan ("Rush Hour"), and let's not
        forget Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson ("Shanghai Knights"). Though many (but certainly not all) of the
        aforementioned films are indeed funny, few have any real lasting qualities and even fewer a challenging
        storyline. The best they can often do is throw an alluring female co-star between the two leads, but I digress.
      </p>
      <p>This film however, stands a monumental achievement. Firstly, the cast is really something else. Robert Downey
        Jr. as our titular character, and he does a bang up job playing a man who's a mystery in himself. Jude Law is
        entertaining and I'm glad Eddie Marsan was aboard. Mark Strong makes for a very impressive antagonist, and
        Rachel McAdams is a seductive femme fatale of sorts. The gloomy setting, 1800s London, couldn't be better
        realized and it definitely gives the film a darker tone.</p>
      <p>Most importantly though, the story is truly a one-of-a-kind detective tale. It really is a pitting of
        rationality vs. superstition, and to my heart-thumping exhilaration for the majority of the film you would think
        good old logic had been defeated. Moving on before I spoil anything. The plot twists and turns menacingly, and
        lea
        ves one astounded by the effort put into the writing.</p>
      <p>Lastly, kudos to composer Hans Zimmer who did a very catchy leitmotif that fit the film perfectly. The
        gray-blue cinematography is great, and I've got to congratulate Guy Ritchie on his feat.</p>

      <p>Sherlock Holmes - Based on the books by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the popular detective is portrayed by Robert
        Downey Jr. His loyal companion Watson (played superbly by Jude Law) is getting married and Holmes is none too
        happy. Their antics are put on the shelf because Lord Blackwood (ice cold Mark Strong), a powerful man of the
        occult world, has committed a series of murders. When he is hung, he rises from the grave and promises to
        drastically change the world with himself as master. With the future of several countries at stake, it is up to
        Holmes to stop Blackwood. Downey Jr. disappears into the role like the character does with various disguises. He
        is completely believable as a detective whose deductive skills are so powerful that, without focus, mundane
        situations are overwhelming to his psyche. The film and role are his.</p>
      <p>Holmes is portrayed as a borderline manic depressive eccentric who cannot function unless he has a goal to
        accomplish. In other words: Robert Downey Jr. The film has fun exploring the part of Holmes left untouched by
        the films done by varying Television productions for many years. Namely: the physical side of Holmes. Yes,
        Holmes is a boxer, stick/sword fighter, and a martial artist. It was in the books, and it is done in this film
        as well. He flung Moriarty down a chasm with jujitsu in one of the stories for God's sake! It always bothered me
        that Holmes's eccentricities and drug-use seemed to be shelved on the screen in favor of a more well-put
        together stern man who would never deign to get his hands dirty. Holmes was never meant to be a symbol of
        stiff-upper lip Britain, yet that's what he became. The obvious reasons behind these choices were probably
        finances (or lack thereof concerning fight co-ordination) and censorship. It's funny how interpretations work.
        Icons are taken down such a strange path that, when someone decides to bring them to where they started, the old
        looks new. Batman was always noir. Bond was a quipless suave killer. Holmes could fight.
      </p>
      <p>A down and dirty Holmes is more interesting (surprise!) to a 21st century audience than an omniscient
        uppercrust man eternally in a bathrobe. This Holmes is fairly true to the original character. It may not be true
        to the Holmes some people have in their heads, but that version cherry picks elements of Doyle's original
        creation. Actually this Watson is not as close to the original version (younger with no limp), but this Watson
        ties Holmes to reality, is less of an audience fill-in (read: a dumb shmoe) and kicks some major ass.</p>
      <p>The film is riveting with only a few parts that actually lag. Huge explanations are saved until the end. We
        realize we have seem more or less all that Holmes has seen, and yet he gleaned far far more with his powerful
        intellect. Guy Ritchie's directing is vast and yet detail oriented. It's fairly comprehensible yet there is
        enough in the dialogue and character relationships to warrant future viewings.</p>
      <p>Sherlock Holmes is smart and entertaining, a combination which always works better than either adjective by
        itself. This is an invigorating re-boot that reminds us why the detective is such an icon. Robert Downey Jr. and
        Jude Law have perfect chemistry like an old married couple. Mark Strong plays a chilling villain and one lament
        is that, as part of the film is spent trying to find him, his performance is surprisingly brief. Rachel McAdams
        is the one part of casting that feels disingenuous. She's not quite devilish or sensuous enough to be the one
        woman that outsmarted Sherlock Holmes. Still, a thoroughly entertaining film for the head and heart. I look
        forward to the inevitable sequel. A-</p>

      <p class="mt-3">I was about ready to question the legitimacy of Sherlock Holmes (Robert Downey Jr.) adding martial
        arts skills to his repertoire, but a few other reviewers set me straight on that point. The camaraderie between
        Holmes and his partner Watson (Jude Law) points to a decidedly more equitable relationship between the two than
        was ever exhibited between Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce, or any of the other pairings I've seen from the
        Thirties and Forties. The whole idea takes a little getting used to, and in the hands of a less capable director
        than Guy Ritchie, might not have worked out quite as well. Ritchie applies a lot of the smart-alecky type of
        humor evident in such earlier efforts as "Snatch" and "Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels". Robert Downey Jr.
        takes to his role well by applying some of that old Tony Stark arrogance and comes off as a master tactician.
        That is, if you find credible such mental feats as describing the path to the headquarters of Sir Thomas
        Rotheram's (James Fox) Temple of the Four Orders while blindfolded. While generally enjoying the story, I kept
        wondering whether the name of Professor Moriarty would ever wind up being mentioned, and on that point, Irene
        Adler (Rachel McAdams) provided a clue near the end of the story as well as capably setting up a sequel. For
        fans of the old time Sherlock Holmes flicks, this one might appear a bit jarring for one's tastes, though I
        found it rather entertaining myself. It appears that a modern day franchise has been well established.</p>
